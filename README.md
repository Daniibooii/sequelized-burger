# sequelized-burger

# Project Description
__project on hold for now__
This project simulates a restaurant app that allows its users to create a burger.<br>
It utilizes MySQL, Node, Handlebars, a number of Node dependencies such as Sequelize, as well as CSS, JS, etc.<br>

This is an updated version of the earlier project "burger," but now utilizing Sequelize.<br>

## How to Use
Access directly on Heroku at: __will add later if hosted to Heroku__,<br>
or DL my repo and run it through Node yourself: https://github.com/Daniibooii/sequelized-burger<br>

To play, just let the app know what you'd like to eat!<br>
In-game instructions and buttons will lead the way.<br>

## How to Install & Run
To install,
- clone the repo
- run `npm install`

To run,
- run `npm run start`
- in a browser, open http://localhost:8080

## Project Goals
Remove all references to MySQL queries, replace them with Sequelize queries<br>
Replace my model with Sequelized version<br>
Add default value of false where needed<br>

Ensure config.json includes proper DB configs<br>
Add Sequelize's ORM methods<br>
Add JawsDB so it can be hosted to Heroku<br>
-I may not actually host to Heroku, as I am running out of repos<br>
